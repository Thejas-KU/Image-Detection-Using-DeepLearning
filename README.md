ðŸ§  Deep Learning Project - Image Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
This project demonstrates how deep learning techniques, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), can be used to classify and detect images. The goal is to build a model that accurately distinguishes between different image classes using TensorFlow and Keras.

ðŸ–¼ Project Overview
Project Title: Image Detection using CNN
Type: Deep Learning / Computer Vision
Frameworks Used: TensorFlow, Keras
Dataset Used: Custom or standard image dataset (e.g., cats vs dogs)
ðŸ“š Technologies & Libraries Used
Python
Jupyter Notebook
TensorFlow / Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib
OS & pathlib (for directory operations)
ðŸ—‚ Dataset Structure
The dataset is structured in a directory format: dataset/ â”œâ”€â”€ train/ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ class1/ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ class2/ â””â”€â”€ test/ â”œâ”€â”€ class1/ â””â”€â”€ class2/

Each class directory contains images relevant to that class.
